This repository contains documentation for creating PLCnext app containers as well as demo PLCnext apps for different app types including their source files.

## PLCnext App-Parts

For the full documentation about the procedure for creating PLCnext apps and their packaging in the corresponding app container see the "PLCnext Technology - PLCnext App Integration Guide" on the PLCnext Community site ([Link to PLCnext App Integration Guide](http://plcnext-app-integration-guide.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/)). A PLCnext App must contain a Metadata-App-part and at least one optional App-part.

| # | App-Part | Description | Type |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Metadata | App meta information such as identifier and version  | Mandatory |
| 2 | PLCnext Engineer App | Contains a complete PLCnext Engineer project configuration (solution app) | Optional |
| 3 | Command line tools | A command line tool can be integrated into a PLCnext system in the form of an app. The command line tool can then be started from a shell without specifying the full path. | Optional |
| 4 | Shared libraries | Shared libraries can be integrated into the app container and made known to the Linux system when the app is installed/activated | Optional |
| 5 | Linux Daemons | A (Linux) daemon (exe) can be integrated into a PLCnext system in the form of an app | Optional |
| 6 | PLCnext Extensions | Extensions of the PLCnext runtime can be integrated into a PLCnext system in the form of an app. With a PLCnext extension, the PLCnext runtime can be extended by the following elements: <ul><li> A process dependent on the PLCnext runtime (PLCnext process) </li><li> A PLCnext shared library (PLCnext library). Usually it belongs to a PLCnext component </li><li> A PLCnext component (PLCnext component) </li><ul> | Optional |
| 7 | Configuration of the PLCnext Runtime services | PLCnext system services can be enabled/disabled with this app part | Optional |
| 8 | File- / Data-Storage | When necessary, it is used to specify whether a persistent and/or temporary location is required for the App | Optional |
| 9 | Update Configurations | Used to enable auto update mode, keep Apps persistent/temporary data on update or to run an update shell script after installing the new app version | Optional |

The following shows the contents of an app description file in which all types of app parts are configured by way of example:

# Table of Content
This table describes the demo app examples in the git project folder DemoApps

| # | Demo App | Description | Sources |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | PLCnext Engineer App | The demo app with an engineer part (solution app) contains a simple solution for flashing an LED (controlling a digital output) in an AXL F DO16 I/O module. The I/O module is controlled by the controller (AXC F 2152) via Axioline F | [DemoCmdToolApp](/DemoApps/DemoCmdToolApp/) |
| 2 | Command Line Tool App | To demonstrate an app with a CmdTool App-Part a simple tool was developed, which is installed in an app and displays a text message on the console when called from the command line | [DemoEngineerApp](/DemoApps/DemoEngineerApp/) |
| 3 | Linux shared library App | n/a yet | n/a |
| 4 | Linux daemon App | In the SampleLinuxDaemon app the simple program "SampleLinuxDaemon" is started as a Linux daemon, which permanently reads the current time stamp in an endless loop every second and writes it into a log file linuxDaemonOut.log. | [SampleLinuxDaemonApp](/DemoApps/SampleLinuxDaemonApp/) |
| 5 | PLCnext Extensions App | Contains two examples for PLCnext Extensions Apps: <ul><li>Demo PLCnext Runtime App (PLCnext-Process) based on the example in the PLCnext Github Repo [SampleRuntime](https://github.com/PLCnext/SampleRuntime) </li><li>Demo PLCnext-Component App</li></ul> | [PlcnextSampleRuntimeApp](/DemoApps/DemoPlcnextExtensionsApps/PlcnextSampleRuntimeApp/) [WbmPlcnextComponentApp](/DemoApps/DemoPlcnextExtensionsApps/WbmPlcnextComponentApp/)|
| 6 | PLCnext services configuration App | In the demo app for configuring PLCnext system services, the WBM-PLCnext component is switched off. For this the action "MUST_NOT_HAVE" is configured for the Plcnext service with the ID "WBM", therefore the name "SC_WBM-MNH" is selected for the app. | [DemoPlcnextServicesConfigApp](/DemoApps/DemoPlcnextServicesConfigApp/) |
| 7 | Data Storage | The procedure for using and configuring a Data Storage App Part is explained in the demo apps "Demo PLCnext Runtime App" and "Demo Linux Daemon App" | [PlcnextSampleRuntimeApp](/DemoApps/DemoPlcnextExtensionsApps/PlcnextSampleRuntimeApp/)  [SampleLinuxDaemonApp](/DemoApps/SampleLinuxDaemonApp/) |
| 8 | Update configs | The update configs demo App contains an App container to update demo App [SampleLinuxDaemonApp](/DemoApps/SampleLinuxDaemonApp/) from app version 123.11.6.0 to 123.11.6.9 | [SampleLinuxDaemonUpdateApp](/DemoApps/SampleLinuxDaemonUpdateApp/) |
